Debugging sayHello function


The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard.
It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

Example output:

Hello, Mr. Spock


아래와 같이 주어지는데 매개변수 name 을 뒤에 붙여서 반환해주면 된다.

function sayHello(name) {
  return 'Hello'
}

///


function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`
}
