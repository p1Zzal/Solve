7kyu
Over The Road

Task
You've just moved into a perfectly straight street with exactly n identical houses on either side of the road. 
Naturally, you would like to find out the house number of the people on the other side of the street. The street looks something like this:

Street
1|   |6
3|   |4
5|   |2
Evens increase on the right; odds decrease on the left. House numbers start at 1 and increase without gaps. When n = 3, 1 is opposite 6, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 2.

Example (address, n --> output)
Given your house number address and length of street n, give the house number on the opposite side of the street.

1, 3 --> 6
3, 3 --> 4
2, 3 --> 5
3, 5 --> 8


Note about errors
If you are timing out, running out of memory, or get any kind of "error", read on. 
Both n and address could get upto 500 billion with over 200 random tests. 
If you try to store the addresses of 500 billion houses in a list then you will run out of memory and the tests will crash. 
This is not a kata problem so please don't post an issue. Similarly if the tests don't complete within 12 seconds then you also fail.

To solve this, you need to think of a way to do the kata without making massive lists or huge for loops. Read the discourse for some inspiration :)

양쪽 다 n개만큼의 집이 있는 거리로 이사간다.
내 주소 반대편에 있는 집의 번호를 알고싶다.
왼쪽 길은 +2 만큼 증가하고 오른쪽길은 -2 만큼 감소한다.

///

맨 처음에 배열 두 개를 만들어 for문을 써서 +2 씩 증가하는 배열, -2 씩 감소하는 배열을 만들어서 문제를 풀었으나,
시간이 오래걸려서 다른 방법이 없을까 하면서 문제를 자세히 보았다.
그랬더니 매개변수 n*2 - address-1 의 값이 반환값임을 찾았다.

function overTheRoad(address, n){
  return (n*2) - (address - 1)
}
