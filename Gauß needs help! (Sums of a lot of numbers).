7kyu
Gauß needs help! (Sums of a lot of numbers).


Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young Gauß, Herr J.G. 
Büttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, 
while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n.

Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

Here's, an example:

f(n=100) // returns 5050 
It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#, 0 for COBOL).

Note: the goal of this kata is to invite you to think about some 'basic' mathematic formula and how you can do performance optimization on your code. 

Advanced - experienced users should try to solve it in one line, without loops, or optimizing the code as much as they can.

매개변수 n 이 주어진다.
1부터 n까지의 수를 모두 더한수를 반환하면된다.
n이 정수가 아니거나 0 이하 이면 false 를 반환한다.

학창시절에 배웠었다. 1 부터 100까지를 모두 더하는 방법은 1 + 100, 2 + 99 ... 등으로 바꿀 수 있다고.
또 쉽게 바꾸면 (1 + 100) * 50 이랑 똑같다고.
그걸 이용해서 풀었다.

function f(n){
  return Number.isInteger(n) && n > 0 ? (n+1) * (n/2) : false
};
